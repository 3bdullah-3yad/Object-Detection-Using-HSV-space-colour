# HSV/HSL
HSV/HSL is an alternative representation of the RGB color space. It
consists of the following components:
- Hue
- Saturation
- Value
- Lightness
<br>`Hue` is a property that describes three colors: green, red, and magenta. It
can also be a mixture of two pure colors: red and yellow, and yellow and green.
<br>`Saturation` measures the intensity of an image. It tells us how far a color
is from gray. A lower value means the color is approaching gray.
<br>`Lightness` refers to the intensity of color with respect to white. It tells us
how far a color is from white.
<br>`Value` is another measure of intensity. It tells us how far a color is from black.
